## Approach
I used many approaches. First to improve on my JavaScript knowledge I used AI to help explain how common syntax in python would be written in javaScript. This helped me gain an understanding of certain basic important concepts that I did not yet know in JavaScript.

Then to get started on the problems I used the Postman extension in VScode to test all the endpoints and make sure the server could run successfully. Once I tested all endpoints and vonfirmed they were all working I could use the fetch function in JavaScript to start connecting the frontend and backend.

To set up the HTML I mixed my own knowledge with other online solutions to create a table and format the page so that the buttons would fit alongside the table without the user having to scroll

For my CSS customisations I made use of W3Schools and their different web pages for CSS customisations to help choose how to style my web page. To choose the colour for the web page I found Lilly's CSS through the website and used the same hexadecimal colour code as they used to fit the theming/colouring.

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
I'm particularly proud of my JavaScript frontend code as starting out I had a limited knowledge of javaScript but feel over the course of the challenge got to terms with the basics and was able to connect the frontend and backend using javaScript in a coherant and functional manner which I did not understand how to do when starting out the challenge
More specifically my renderMedicines function which take the data of the json database and presents it in a readable HTML format ready for the index.html to use. This was particularly complx and a large challenge going into the project but one I managed to work past.

I am also proud of my get_average_med_price function as it was the only endpoint I created myself. Not only was this somthing I had not done in python before but it was also the one part of the project which stretched from the backend in the database right the way through to the user end of the frontend which was solely programmed by me. Making me proud that I proved to myself I could do every part of the project despite finding it intimidating at the start.

## Problems Faced
my original problem came during the very beggining of the project. After cloning the repositry I had to read up on postman to understand how it worked and found setting up my venv was difficult and new but managed to get it set up.

Then had some issues with the postman and found that the update didnt always show the correct output without restarting the local server however once this was ironed out I felt strongly

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*
